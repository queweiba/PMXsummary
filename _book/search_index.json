There are some parts of knowledge that you need to know, which are related to different phase of modeling building process. All these models form the equation of likelihood function of each observation in a popPK analysis. Structural model In most cases, some information is available beforehand about the structural model based on knowledge on the underlying system. E.g., PK equations Inter-individual variability: Information about IIV can also be available in terms of physiological features of the study population such as polymorphism in metabolic enzymes or age-related alterations of particular organs. residual variability That part accounts for all remaining variability which is not explained by the structural or parameter-variability model parts. This RUV arises for example from physiological intra-individual variation, assay error, errors in independent variables and model misspecification. All of this will form the mathematical formula that are assessed to evaluate the model fit. In NONMEM, The Nonmem methodology was based on maximum likelihood methods that use various approximations to compute and minimize the objective function (-2 log likelihood of the model parameters given the data) in order to estimate population PK and PK-PD model parameters.

[["index.html", "A Minimal Book Example Chapter 1 About 1.1 Usage 1.2 Render book 1.3 Preview book", " A Minimal Book Example John Doe 2024-06-24 Chapter 1 About This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
