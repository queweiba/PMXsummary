# Model evaluation makes it easy

*Residuals-based method*

 (ref: Developing tools to evaluate non-linear mixed effect models: 20 years on the npde adventure)
 
-	Prediction error (difference between the true value and the prediction, bias)
-	RMSE? (the magnitude of PE, imprecision)
  Shortcomings:
	  - Prediction error of population predictions or individual predictions?
  Population residuals
o	Individual residuals, more focused on evaluation of the residual error model
·	Potential heteroscedasticity in the residual error model (magnitude of residuals varies across the range of observations)
Solution: 
·	weighted residuals (WRES), weighting the residuals using the expected variance of the prediction
