## Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs)
NODE is basically an ordinary differential equation (ODE), the difference is that the right-hand side of the ODE is not described with mechanism-based functions, as it is tipically done in PMX, but it consistes of neural networks (NNs)

** Criticisms**
- They are "black box" models
- They have poor extrapolation capabilities
- They do not include prior clinical knowledge
